## Wait, but what is Hacktober? üéÉ

1. üèö Trick or treating - meet your neighbors: **Stand Up, Halloween style** _What is one spooky, terrifying thing that has scared you recently and how are you or did you get over it?_
Extra-long pairing time:
2. :ghost: **Boo!** _try something that utterly scares you,_ - a Haunted Mansion of legacy, untested, out-of-date code? a new spooky framework, a side-project you've been trying to perfect, Vim, anything you want - with a pair, even better. It's okay if you get scared - that's the point. Bonus points: write a blog post about it or share your 
3. :candy: Give out **treats**: There are lots of ways to give `treats` in the digital world: upping a StackOverflow question / answer that helped you, adding notes of thanks to developers/designers of your favorite open source tools, did someone -- a person at a meetup, a free tutorial, a video blog, an author -- help you in a project? Send them a treat by writing them a thank you tweet/note.
4. :jack_o_lantern: Teach **tricks and learn a trick**: Go out of your way to take 3 minutes to look up that keyboard shortcut, create that alias, or learn some other new side-trick you've been meaning to practice. learn a new command line command. then teach your neighbor.
